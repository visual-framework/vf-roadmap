# vf-roadmap

What we're working on in the coming months. [View the project dashboard](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-roadmap/projects/1)

## How we use this

The "issues" in this project are high-level strategic actions that will have many tactical issues spread across [Visual Framework projects](https://github.com/visual-framework)

## What an strategic issue should look like

An example:

```md

# Design token usage and maturiaty

We now use Design Tokens across the project, however we need to enrich them and improve the documtentation.

- [ ] EMBL Grey Light and EMBL Grey Lightest 
- [ ] Documentation needs to include all Design Tokens 
- [ ] Add Animations
- [ ] Add and RGBA colours
- [ ] `z-index` needs to be consolidated into Design Tokens
- [ ] INVESTIGATE - moving to primary, secondary, tertiary themed tokens so we don't rely on `color`. 

```

This way we can then add the relevant issues from other repos and tick of as theyâ€™re done.
